# My Review
This live stream/tutorial showcases some very interesting and useful features you can implement into a ticketing platform.
There is a realtime queuing system.
The whole system runs realtime.
The site owner gets commission from people creating events on their on Stripe account, which which has a full creation flow and custom dahsboard.
